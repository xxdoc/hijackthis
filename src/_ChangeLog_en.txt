New detections are added:
 - O4 - some new detections and improved fixes.
 - O5 - Applet: to detect custom and hijacked control panel items.
 - O7 - AppLocker:
 	* NOTE!!! Applocker is by default in whitelisting mode: everything that is not explicitly allowed, is blocked.
 	* If you remove "(allow)" rule, this particular application/folder will be blocked, until you'll remove all the rules.
 	* To remove all rules at once, it's better to fix the special line "O7 - AppLocker: fix all"

 - O7 - TroubleShooting: new environment variables are added.
 - O22 - BITS Job: to detect foreign Windows Update Service jobs.

	* (user missing) - when user/group is removed;
	* (no xml) - when xml file doesn't exist;
	* (key missing) - when associated reg. key doesn't exist;
	* (no key) - when no task keys are referred to;
	* (empty) - when tasks folder or key contains an empty record;
	* This doesn't include xml integrity/CRC check and "DynamicInfo / Triggers" validation.

Interface:
 - Added ability to mark multiple items for fixing with 'Shift + Click'.
 - Added "Copy" multi-context menu in scan results window (thanks @TheTrick for helping with Clipboard).
 - Added "VirusTotal" multi-context menu in scan results window with options to check file/URL by hash or to submit file with SysInternals Autoruns.

Report:
> General:
 - Sorting is now going in correct alphabetical order + increased the speed.
 - O4 - Startup subsections are renamed to improve the sorting.
> /Area:Environment:
 - Added registry report of "User Shell Folders" and "Shell Folders" in addition to CLSID-based report.
 Why? Because Microsoft doesn't follow its own 'Best Practice' from MSDN. lol.
> Modules "Check Browsers' LNK" & "ClearLNK":
 - Suppressed "Allow to download..." request when silent mode is selected in "Update" settings.
 - Added auto-update feature (whenever you run the tool) - not often than once per month.
